<h1>
    The Best Color Pallets
</h1>
<div>
<h3>
    And where they came from!
</h3>

<p>
    As an artist, I have worked with colors for a long long time. Some of my inspirations for my favorite pallets comes from gaming, some from cartoons and anime, and some from other artists. Here are my personal favorite color pallets from all my years of consuming artistic medias.

<h2>
    Steven Universe
</h2>
<blockquote>
    Because Steven Universe has my all time favorite color pallets out there, <a href="about.html">I designated this site to it.</a> This show by far has my favorite color pallets  out there, and I take inspiration from it on the regular. The most consistant part of Steven Universe's color pallete is the pastels. There is a pastel theme in every screenshot grabbed; making the scenes feel soft, fresh, and clean.

<blockquote>
    For the longest time, I  have not only enjoyed this game, but also its music, art, writing, and style. This game has a cozy, nostalgic color pallete thats carried throuhout the whole game. From the snowy parts of the map to the lava flooded, the color pallete sticks to a rusty and toned version of each color used. The pixelated art style adds to this nostalgic feeling. I want to encorperate color pallets like this into my work as well. The pixelated art style is also something I want to incorperate into my personal art, as it makes everything feel a bit older, less modern and sharp.

    Art Direction in Undertale
</h3>

<blockquote>
    Temmie Chang worked as the main artist for the game, providing most of the sprites and concept art. Toby Fox has said that the game's art style would likely remain the same if he had access to a larger team of artists. He found that "there's a psychological thread that says audiences become more attached to characters drawn simply rather than in detail", particularly benefiting from the use of visual gags within the art.

Strayuu is an artist named Ekendra, who works as a hoyocreator. They make sketchy, loose digital drawings and have worked for genshin impact and hoyo to create offical art. They are an animation student based in Spain, working on getting a graduate degree! I have followed Strayuu since October of last year and have really fallen in love with their artstyle. They are inspired by a lot of things that also inspire me, like genshin impact, evangellion, and mob physco. Here is there linktree, I really encourage you support them or check out their work! Its genuinely my favorite, I really love their loose style and the deeper, less saturated colors they use. <a href="https://linktr.ee/strayuu"style="color:brown">Here is Strayuu's link tree!</a>
