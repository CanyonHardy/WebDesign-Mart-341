<h2>
    About the Show
    </h2>
<blockquote>
    Steven Universe is a cartoon that really impacted my childhood/early teenage years. Heres a small descriton of the show itself: "Steven Universe is an American animated television series created by Rebecca Sugar for Cartoon Network. It tells the coming-of-age story of a young boy, Steven Universe (Zach Callison), who lives with the Crystal Gems—magical, mineral-based aliens named Garnet (Estelle), Amethyst (Michaela Dietz), and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall)—in the fictional town of Beach City. " The show ran from November 2013 to January 2019. The TV film Steven Universe: The Movie was released in September 2019, and an epilogue limited series, Steven Universe Future, ran from December 2019 to March 2020. And I have always ADORED the color pallets in this show. There are more than enough examples of screencaps to display how every single frame has a pleasing pallete.

<h3>
    Backgrounds
</h3>
<blockquote>
    The backgrounds in Steven Universe are my main source of inspiration from color pallets, and in this site I am for the majority using screenshots of the backgrounds alone. Here is a quote from the wiki about how these backgrounds are achieved. " Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is "having a cohesive underlying structure to everything". Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter Paul Cézanne, whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by Tao Te Ching, whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, "like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful".During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as "descriptive bones" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line. The painters used "superimposed" watercolor texture before switching to Photoshop because the former made the backgrounds "very chunky". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background."

<h3>
    Art Director Elle Michalka
</h3>

<blockquote>
    These color pallets would not be possible without Elle's incredible artistic eye, and her hand on the art direction of the show. Color has been a huge part of defining the storytelling and atmosphere of Steven Universe since the show began. Elle shared her thoughts on the use of color in the title sequence: "Color is huge! Even standard SU earth colors have a bit of electricity in them but I tried to push more digital neons at the end. For lighting, it follows the story, so we used a lot of warm, bright colors in the beginning and cool, darker colors at the end. I think I had initially made the closeup shot of the Temple hand a dusk palette which was pretty on its own, but we eventually had to change it to daylight to fit it in with the sequence."

    Canyon's Favorites
</h3>

    Personally, I do have a favorite screenshots of backgrounds from the show. However, I feel, and have always felt, that steven universe can be screenshotted at any moment, ANY frame, and the colors will always be pleasing. The wide variety of colors used in this show are always presented in a way that is easy to look at, even if they are highly saturated. I find this extremely impressive and hard to replicate. Often for my own artwork, I will screenshot a scene from the show that has roughly the colors I need for my piece, and use the eyedrop tool to steal the colors directly. Elle really knows how to put a color pallete together.
