<h3>
    My history with painting
</h3>


<blockquote>
    Painting is definitely my least active art medium that I still consider important to my overall portfolio. Despite doing it the least of my main three mediums, I really really love painting, specifically in acrylics. I began painting in watercolor as a really young kid. My first painting that I was proud of was a red robin, perched on a branch. I was in 4rth grade when I made that painting, and it still hangs in my moms house, right by the entrance. I remember making that and feeling like I had potential, for the first time ever. I experienced more with watercolor in my middle school, when I painted a still life of some fake appels in class. My painting was so accurate and close to reality, I felt that same pride I did as an elementary schooler. This inspired me even more to continue to paint, and in highschool I really started to understand how color works. I also learned a lot of techniques for watercolor, like using salt, cotton balls, and towels to create textures. I also really started to begin understanding the color wheel in highschool, and how there was a spectrum to creating interesting colors that weren't just right off the paint cup. I also began to experiment with acrylics in highschool, in my free time. I used the cheapest acrylic paint in Walmart and continued to try in my own efforts to make pieces I wanted in my space. I followed Bob Ross videos for a long time to really understand landscapes, as well as free-hand screencaps from Steven universe and Bee and Puppycat. I really started getting good at color matching when I started using paint in my cosplays- painting acrylics onto handmade weapon props and fabric. I had to color match to make the cosplays match the colors I referenced on a screen, and this built a lot of skills I still use in my work today.

    Where I am now with painting
</h3>
<p>
    I can happily say I feel like I have perfected working with apple-barrels cheap acrylic paints. I understand how fast they dry, how to color mix the exact tone I need, when I can apply water, and how to fix mistakes from previous passings. When it comes to watercolor, gouache and oils, I feel a LOT less confident for these skills. I can safely say I understand the basics of these other painting mediums, but I have no where near perfected them, nor do I feel like I can make great work with them. Even other brands of acrylic paint behave differently than apple barrel paints do, so I can't say I have mastered acrylics either. I do really have a lot of love for the painting medium, despite being nowhere near an expert with it.

    For my current painting, I am a huge fan of the cheapest and most accessible paint on the market, which is Plaid's Apple Barrel acrylic paint.</p><p>

It's long lasting if you can incorporate it with water and don't use the paint directly from the bottle. It also can be slightly erased with water, in incase you make any mistakes in your piece. Ass for paintbrushes, literally any brush works for me, as long as I have a varied amount of sizes. Brands don't really matter when it comes to brushes in my opinion, but the only brushes I always avoid are the small, black bristled ones that come in cheap watercolor sets. These tiny, plastic brushes are TERRIBLE and I always avoid them.
