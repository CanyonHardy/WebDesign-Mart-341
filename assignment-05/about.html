        <p> Here's a well worded description of this character, thanks to the genshin impact <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Gorou">fandom wiki. </a> "Gorou is a supporting playable character of action-adventure game made in 2020, Genshin impact. Gorou was a member of the general's Watatsumi army who got a plan of resistance to stop against the Vision Hunt Decree. He has pointy dog ears and a bushy tail of the same color; with white highlights on the front of his hair, ears, and tail."</p>

    This character combines all of the things that i love from the other characters in my list. He has;
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Flat and visibly soft chest</li>
    <li> Fluffy short hair</li>
    <li> Short, small body type</li>
    <li> Doggy ears hehehehe </li>
    <li> So anti-gender like there is no masc there is no fem</li>
</ol>

<p>
    This concludes my evidence for why Gorou is the ultimate gender envy. I want to be a soft dog boy so bad and honestly i will cosplay this one day and ascend to heaven out of pure joy.
