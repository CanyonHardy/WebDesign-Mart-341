i visited the webkinz website when i visited the wayback machine. The year I looked at was close to webkinz release date, feb 1st in 2007. The websites design is much differant now, and looking back on it I felt a lot of nostalgia for the origional art and artstyle of the classic website. The new website is optimized a lot more, no longer runs on flash, and has 2 versions of the game. The classic is a lot more simple, colorful, and reminescant of the 2000's.
