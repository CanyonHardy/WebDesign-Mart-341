            These are characters I wish i looked like, from least envious to most- specifically for how they present themselves in a gender context. If 'gender envy' is a bit confusing, here's an article to gain a <a href= "https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Gender_Envy"> deeper understanding of what "gender envy" </a> means.

        <p>
            Benard from megamind has always made me want glasses, even since I was a kid. Now i wear circle glasses just like his every day, i'm not sure what it is about them but they just provide such a neutral gender vibe. I also love his fluffy hair and turtleneck. Something about it, man.

            #9 <b> Xiao </b> (genshin impact)

<p>
    Xiao is my favorite genshin impact character. Although there are 3 other genshin imact characters in this list, he's my favorite character wise. I envy his gender because hes so masculine and pretty at the same time.

    #8 <b> James, Team Rocket </b> (pokemon)
</h2>

<p>
    The fashion James has just gets me. Also I love his long, soft blue hair. Seems like he would never understand gender (because hes so dumb) but if he did, he would be genderfluid. I just know it, i feel it in my bones.

<h2> 
    #7 <b> Raine </b>  (the owl house)
</h2>

<p> 
    Raine is a canonical nonbinary character in the owl house, which is hard to come by these days. The other characters refer to them with they/them pronouns, and watching this show as a nonbinary person made me feel really <b> seen </b>through this character. I also love their circle glasses (idk why circle glasses just get me its SO gender) and their soft and fluffy colored hair.

<h2> #6 <b> Heizou </b> (genshin impact)</h2>

<p>
    Heizou is a very very pretty genshin impact character, like Xiao, but i think he's got a lot more envy from me than Xiao. I don't know much about his character, but his design makes me wish I was a red haired flat chested detective. It's the hair, chest and eye makeup that I envy the most from him.

<h2> #5 <b> Neil Bowman </b> (all saints street)</h2>

<p>
    Neil Bowman is a gender fluid (but mostly masc presenting) demon from the chinese anime 'all saints street'. He's got fluffy white hair and cute lil horns and ears. I really love this character design and wish i looked like him because he's just SO CUTE AHHH!!! I just wish people saw me like how i see him- a cute+small+soft little guy. 
</p>

<h2> #4 <b> Inch </b> (a beanie baby)</h2>

<p> 
    I know what your thinking- "jeez canyon, you sure are showing a pattern of liking soft anime guys with circle glasses" but HAH! Im weird and simply cannot explain this one!! This is literally just what my soul feels like!! A little colorful worm!! Its so gender!!! I wish people perceive me like how i perceive inch!!
</p>

<h2> #3 <b> Sabito </b> (demon slayer)</h2>

<p> 
    Yeah i'm back to the pattern again. Inch is a valid and realistic example of what i want my gender to be presented as, but its a lot more common for me to find actual people that i wish i looked like. Anyway, Sabito from demon slayer is literally only in one episode but he is just so pretty, and I wish i presented like how he does; soft, masculine and feminine, and really warm.
</p>

<h2> #2 <b> Aether </b> (genshin impact)</h2>

<p>
    Maybe it's because Aether (his canonical name) is the male option for a main character in genshin impact that i feel so much envy toword him. Having him on my screen as i played a huge majority of the game made me feel like i <b> was </b> him. And i really enjoyed this feeling, because he is so incredibly gender neutral looking. i love his long fishtail braid, his soft and sweet golden eyes, and his outfit that really doesn't feel very masculine or feminine. I love this character, and his gender presentation really makes me jealous!
</p>

<h2> #1 <B> GOROU!! </B> (genshin impact)</h2>

<p> Ah yes. My number 1. And because hes my favorite gender envy, <a href="about.html"> let's take a closer look at his character,</a> and what makes me want to be him so badly.
