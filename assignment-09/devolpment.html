Magna Ruina is still in the bare bones phase of development. Characters still need to be designed, stories still need endings and beginnings, differant game routes need to be planned, coders and programmers need to be involved with getting the games basic functions secured. That being said, Mgana Ruina IS under current development by Canyon Hardy, the creator and head developer, Jesse Albendego, the programmer/coder, and Amber Lewis, the story writer and director. These three devolpers are working hard to get Magna Ruina into the coding phase, but they want the story, background, style, and composition of the game to be solid before they make any moves for coding the game.

    Manga Ruina is fairly comparable to undertale, considering its size, style, etc. This video explains how one developer created this masterpeice, which inspires our development team to continue the efforts of making Magna Ruina. </mark>

        <blockquote><mark style="background: #E6E6FA">
            The hud is integral to the gameplay of Magna Ruina because of the valuable information it shares, as well as being a helpful link to finding your stats, relationship statusi with characters, health, speed, magica levels, your characters profile, the settings, etc. The relationship status hud shows the character you're talking with relationship to you, and whatever you choose in your dialogue replies will affect this meter. This hud will be displayed on the top left of the screen. </mark>

            <mark style="background: #E6E6FA">
            While your character is walking around the cave system, the hud for your profile current stats, items, and health+stamina+magic bar will be shown in the bottom left. If you are hurt by an enemy, or falling terrain, or taking fall damage, the hp bar will decrease. If your character sprints, does a heavy attack, or rolls, the stamina bar will decrease. If your character uses magica to attack, fix terrain, or solve puzzles, the magica bar will decrease. Enemies have a small HP hud that will float above their head. When your character enters a battle/combat situation, your hud will change from displaying only your profile to displaying all of your party's characters. Switching to another character in your party, you will see that character's specific hub stats. </mark>
