Learning html was really fun! I am suprised with my confidence for website building, and did not expect to enjoy thi so much! I have really felt able to get into a solid workflow once i start coding, and that was super unexpected! 
Preparing to learn CSS, i am a bit afraid. I really like styling my websites right there in the HTML page, and seeing how HTML and CSS interact with design is going to make it feel a bit more convuluded. I guess im just nervous about my workflow, and adding another page would definetly mean thers a lot more room for error. but, I didnt expect to like HTML this much, so I suppose its very possible for me to fall in love witth CSS!

Here are my links to my screenshots! Lots of code so there is a lot this time.
