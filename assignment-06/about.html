<h3>
    What do artifacts even do?
</h3>
<p>
    Artifacts greatly affect your characters performance in game. Despite only dealing with artifacts in the character menu or when you need to spend mora, artifacts deeply change your characters main stats, effecting how much support, attack, or defense they give to your team. Arataki Itto is naturally built as a DPS character, so using specific artifacts to enhance his DPS abilities makes him shine even brighter on the battlefield.

<h3> Defender's Will</h3>


<p>
    This artifact set is perfect for a low level Itto, or low AR player. <i>Defender's will </i>increased some of Itto's naturally weak stats, like defense and elemental resistance. This set is recommended as a 4 piece for beginners, as the 4 piece stats grant a lot more than the 2 peice stats.
</p>
<blockquote>
    2-PC: DEF +30%
4-PC: Increases Elemental RES by 30% for each element present among your characters in the party. This artifact is known as <q>An iris that was cherished by the gaurdian. Unfortunatley, the chance never came for it to be given to whom the gaurdian loved.</q>

<h3>
    3. Archaic Petra
</h3>
<p> 
    This artifact set focouses on Itto's Geo damage bonus stats. <i> Archaic Petra</i> is easily accsessable, and when combined into a 4 piece set, creates a powerful Gwo build for Itto.

<blockquote>

<h3>
    2. Retracing Bollide
</h3>
<p>
    The 4 piece set of <i> Retracing Bollide</i> hits Arataki Itto where he needs it, his sheild. If you want your Itto to be out on the field, making moves and taking damage, youre going to need a capable shield. Also, considering your Itto is usually doing charged attacks, this artifact set as a 4 piece is perfect.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Retracing Bollide as a 2 piece artifact set increases Shield Strength by 35%. As a 4-piece; While protected by a shield, gain an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG. <q> A man-made flower in eternal bloom. Who knows if there truly is life in there?</q>

<h3> 
   1. Husk of Opulent Dreams
</h3>

<p>
The best artifact set for Arataki Itto is the 4 piece <i>Husk of Opulent Dreams</i> set. This combines defensive and geo bonus stats, the two strongest and most needed stats for Itto. The substats also create stacks, which Itto already naturally does. This artifact set was made with Itto in mind, and if you want to work with his built in character stats, this is the artifact for you.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Husk of opulent dreams as a 2-piece set: DEF +30%. 4p piece: A character equipped with this Artifact set will obtain the Curiosity effect in the following conditions: When on the field, the character gains 1 stack after hitting an opponent with a Geo attack, triggering a maximum of once every 0.3s. When off the field, the character gains 1 stack every 3s. Curiosity can stack up to 4 times, each providing 6% DEF and a 6% Geo DMG Bonus. When 6 seconds pass without gaining a Curiosity stack, 1 stack is lost. <q> A small golden ornament with six petals that shall never wilt It symobolizes the transience of moral glories. </q>
