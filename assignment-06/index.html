    <h3> 3 Star Claymores</h3>
    <p> 
        There are a lot of amazing weapon choices for Itto, so why spend all of your primo gems on getting his banner weapon? Here are a few 3 star claymores, if your below AR 40 and need some beginner friendly build options.
    </p>
    <!--I will describe the most reccomended weapon in higher detail at the end of each list-->
    <ul>
        <li>
            White Iron Greatsword
        </li>
        <li>
            Bloodtainted Greatsword
        </li>
        <li>
            Debate Club
        </li>
        <li>
            Ferrous Shadow
        </li>
    </ul>
    <P>
         3 star weapons are not usually reccomended for Itto, beacuse their stats don't work with his particularly well. But the best option of the 3 star claymores for Itto is the <b>White Iron Greatsword</b>. This is because its substat; <i><q>Blunt Confusion </q></i>. 
         <Blockquote>
            After using an Elemental Skill, Normal or Charged Attacks, on hit, deal an additional 60% ATK DMG in a small area. Effect lasts 15s. DMG can only occur once every 3s. Here is what the White Iron Greatsword looks like, as well as the materials you will need to upgrade its level.

<h3> 4 star claymores </h3>
<p>
    If you're a more advanced player that is looking for a build Itto without having to worry about getting a 5 star weapon, look no further! Here are Itto's top 5 <b> BEST </b> 4 star weapons.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Serpant Spine
    </li>
    <li>
        Whiteblind
    </li>
    <li>
        Luxurious Sea-lord
    </li>
    <li>
        Blackcliff Slasher
    </li>
    <li>
        Katsuragikiri Nagamasa
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
The best 4 star weapon for Arataki Itto is by far <b> Serpant Spine</b>, with Whitebind being the second most reccomended. Serpant spine's main stat is Crit <i>Rate</i>, which is much more important than Crit Damage for Itto. The substat on Seprant Spine is <i><q>Wave Splitter</q></i>. 

<blockquote>
    Every 4 seconds on the field, they will deal 6% more DMG and take 3% more DMG. This effect has a maximum of 5 stacks and will not be reset if the character leaves the field, but will be reduced by 1 stack when the character takes DMG. This is what the serpant spine looks like,as well as its the level up materials.

<h3> 5 star claymores</h3>

<p>
    Of course, these weapons are rare and expensive, so this is by no means required to buid your itto into a powerhouse. But if you are willing to grind for it, the results will shine. Ittos best 5 star weapons are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Redhorn Stonethresher
</li>
<li>
    Skyward Pride
</li>
<li>
    Wolf's Gravestone
</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Of course, Itto's best weapon <i>in the game</i> is the one that was released with his banner. Because this banner is only accessable when his banner is up, and to those with primogems, Skyward Pride is an excellent backup claymore, incase you still want him to be the best he can be. <b> Redhorn Stonethrasher</b> is extremely powerful on Arataki Itto, because of its main <i>and</i> substats. This substat is called <q><i>Gokadaiou Otogibanashi</i></q>.
    <blockquote>
        DEF is increased by 28%. Normal and Charged Attack DMG is increased by 40% of DEF. The main stat on Redhorn Stonethresher is Crit Damage. Here are the required materials to upgrade this claymore.
