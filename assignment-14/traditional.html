    Introduction

<h3>
    My history with traditonal
</h3>
I started loving art at a very very young age, specifically 4rth grade when I made a watercolor of a robin. But my drawings haven't been memorable since I was in middle school. I would make poor child's drawings of my stuffed animals, imaginary friends, and other things as a young kid, but I didn't start really taking pride in what I drew until I was in 6th grade. In my art class, I started to learn the very fundamentals, and there, I discovered I wasn't that bad at drawing what I saw in front of me. I really enjoyed learning about the color wheel, perspective, and grid art. In that class, I started to realize that I could create anything I wanted, and it could be good. After learning the very basics, I felt confident trying to draw things out of my comfort zone. I had never attempted to draw ponies, but as a 7th grader, I was too invested in My Little Pony to <i>not</i> try. And when I did try, I actually made something decent looking. This inspired me and I kept drawing SO many ponies, and I actually owe a lot of my artistic development to me drawing so, so many. (I seriously can't tell you how many ponies I was drawing nonstop for like 3 years) Then, I got really inspired in my freshman year of highschool by Steven Universe. The art style and color pallets in that show made me want to try drawing characters, and try using soft pastel colors. I got invested into Undertale in my sophomore year of highschool and couldn't stop creating characters, drawing existing ones, and learning more about how other artists make their own fanart. These three fandoms hugely contribute to my development as an artist- Steven universe taught me how to draw faces and expressions, my little pony helped me learn how to draw fluffy hair and fundamental shapes, and undertale helped me figure out how to create my own characters and learn from other artists. I owe so much to this time in my life, where I was constantly creating art, and constantly improving.

    Where I am now with traditional
</h3>
<p>
    I owe a lot to the days in highschool and middle school when I was constantly creating, and constantly improving. Traditional art has turned into something different for me as a young adult, than it did when I was a teenager. When I was younger, art was a lot more expressive, fun, and something that didn't stress me out. I knew what I was making didn't look amazing, and I was okay with it. Now, I have placed a lot more pressure on myself to be making good art, all the time. The pressure is good for making better art in general, but it's left me feeling like art isn't as fun, or relaxing. I don't have as much to inspire me like I did those days, and if I did, I would be embarrassed to show anyone my art because I know it wouldnt always be up to the standard an artist my age would be making. Let's just say traditional art for me has lost a lot of its childhood magic. I do occasionally still really like it, but for the most part, it's become a stressful medium for me. Digital and paintings still carry the same childhood magic and joy, however.

    Materials
</h2>
<p>
    I have an abundance of supplies for traditional art, despite doing it far less than my other mediums. I usually prefer to sketch, and not finish and flesh out my traditional work, but when I do, it's usually finished with alcohol markers and ballpoint pen. I sketch on a multitude of sketchbooks, but my favorite is the 9in by 12in 'drawing paper' by Strathmore. I actually found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strathmore-400-Sketch-Pads-12/dp/B00C6NCD0E?th=1">the exact same sketchbook on amazon</a> if you're interested in getting it for yourself! This sketchbook has lasted me about 3 years because of the scale and amount of pages it comes with. It's super high quality for the price it's listed as. As for pens and pencils, I don't really have anything as specific. I usually create traditional art with whatever is laying around. But, my all time favorite eraser is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Hi-Polymer-Block-Eraser-ZEH10BP4/dp/B00AZEK8TY/ref=sr_1_4?crid=RKYYKHE1QMQS&keywords=white+erasers&qid=1682028049&s=office-products&sprefix=white+eraser%2Coffice-products%2C163&sr=1-4">high polymer eraser from Pentel.</a> These are always super consistent and high quality. If I ever finish a traditional piece with color, it's with my trusty Ohuhu alcohol markers. This isn't my exact pack, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Tone-Ohuhu-Alcohol-based-Coloring-Illustration/dp/B07X1XMFH6/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_2/130-6215594-3818740?pd_rd_w=AAPPo&content-id=amzn1.sym.26a5c67f-1a30-486b-bb90-b523ad38d5a0&pf_rd_p=26a5c67f-1a30-486b-bb90-b523ad38d5a0&pf_rd_r=EXCWZ6F88SZWT67XASHV&pd_rd_wg=YDelX&pd_rd_r=55cdd6d5-bd55-47eb-b124-914c49ba05dd&pd_rd_i=B07X1XMFH6&psc=1">here's a listing for this brand's markers.</a>

    Process
</h2>
<p>
    Traditional artwork for me has always started with a circle. Anything at all that I draw will begin with a circle, even if it ends up being completely erased later. From there, I place in other loose shapes to make a geometric looking skeleton of the work. Then I start going into details, like making a rough outline of the character or object. After I'm happy with the outline I take the time to erase the previous shape layer. Then it's a simple matter of perfecting details, linework, then color. But, I usually leave my traditional work blank and in a loose sketch form.
