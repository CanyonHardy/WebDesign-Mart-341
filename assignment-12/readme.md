What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
padding always adds extra space around your div element, if your div element had a white background, the white would go further out along each edge of the element. Margign is a location for extactly where on the page you want your div element to be. Borders are colored lines that go around your div element. borders are differant from padding because they can have an entierly seperate border raius, color, size, etc, without disrupting the div. 
Optional: how did this week's assignment go? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
This week was a bit harder, even though we reused a website. CSS is definetly a bit more difficult than just inline styling in HTML in my opinion. I struggled with positioning the  most, because fixed, absolute, and margin numbers all conufuse me.
